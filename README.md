# Lambda Players - MWII Takedowns & Revive System Support
 Adds a support for the [Modern Warfare II - Takedowns & Revive System](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2919957168) addon to [Lambda Players](https://github.com/IcyStarFrost/Lambda-Players). This allows Lambda Players to execute takedowns on their targets and also able to get downed after reaching zero health.
